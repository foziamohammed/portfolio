         Secure Real-Time Messaging System
I developed an end-to-end encrypted chat application that enables secure communication between users. The system features AES-256 encryption 
for all messages, with unique initialization vectors for each transmission to ensure maximum security. Built on a Node.js/Express backend with 
WebSocket integration, it provides real-time messaging capabilities while maintaining message persistence through MongoDB. The platform includes 
JWT authentication for secure access control and a responsive React frontend with intuitive chat interfaces. Designed with security as the top 
priority, the architecture prevents message interception by encrypting all data before transmission and only decrypting it at the recipient's device. 
This project demonstrates my ability to implement complex security protocols while maintaining usability and performance in real-time communication systems.
